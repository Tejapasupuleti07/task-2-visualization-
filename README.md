Interview Questions:

1️. What is the importance of data visualization?
Data visualization helps convert raw data into visual formats like charts and graphs, making it easier to understand patterns, trends, and insights for better decision-making.

2. When do you use a pie chart vs bar chart?
Use a pie chart to show proportions or percentages of a whole (e.g., market share).

Use a bar chart to compare values across categories (e.g., sales by region).

3️.How do you make visualizations more engaging?
By using interactive filters, clear labels, meaningful colors, tooltips, clean design, and focusing on key takeaways instead of overwhelming the viewer with too much data.

4️.What is data storytelling?
Data storytelling is the process of combining data, visuals, and narrative to communicate insights clearly and persuasively to a target audience.

5️.How do you avoid misleading visualizations?

Use correct scales and axes

Avoid cherry-picking data

Label charts clearly

Don’t distort visuals with 3D effects

Always show context and totals where needed

6️.What are best practices in dashboard design?

Keep it simple and focused

Show key metrics at the top

Group related visuals

Use consistent color schemes

Add filters/slicers for interactivity

Use descriptive titles and annotations

7️. What tools have you used for visualization?

I have used Power BI, Tableau, and Excel for creating interactive dashboards, and sometimes Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) for data plotting.
